public class LeapYear {
    /*
     * Design and implement an application that reads an integer value representing a year input by the user.
     * The purpose of the program is to determine if the year is a leap year (and therefore has 29 days in February) in the Gregorian calendar.
     * An error message should be produced if the year input is less than 1582 (the first year of the Gregorian calendar).
     * For example:
     * A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not 400.
     * 2003 is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 4.
     * 2004 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4, but not by 100.
     * 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not leap years because they are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
     * 2000 and 2400 are leap years because they are divisible by 400.
     * Other numbers to Test:
     * Any value less than 1582.
     * 1582, 1584, 1586
     * Other dates
     * Find a website to check your date with leap years
