     * Your goal is to design and implement an application that reads a string from the user and then determines and prints how many vowels (a,e,i,o,u), consonants, spaces, and "other characters" appear in the entire string.
     * First - read in a string.
     * Use the nextLine() method from the Scanner class to read an entire line of text.
     * Convert it to lowercase.
     * Determine its length.
     * Create a loop that strips off one character at a time.
     * Create a separate counter for each vowel (a counter for 'a', a counter for 'e', etc.)
     * Also have one counter for consonants, one for spaces, and one for other characters.
     * Declare them and initialize them all to zero outside of your loop.
     * Inside your loop, check each character to see whether it is a vowel, consonant, space, or other character.
     * Increment the appropriate counter.
     * Afer you have processed the entire string, print out how many of each of those was present in the string.
     * (Your program should contain 8 System.out.println() statements to output the results of your findings.)
