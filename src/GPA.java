     * Write an application to calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA) of a student.
     * Convert each grade into a numerical value (A+ = 4.3, A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, etc.).
     * Use a loop to continue entering grades until a sentinel value of "Q" is entered.
     * You must use a switch statement to determine the GPA for one letter grade.
     * If an invalid grade is entered, print "Invalid grade."
     * Include a method called getGPA that accepts a String as a parameter that represents the grade and converts it to a numerical value.
     * The method getGPA will return -1 if an invalid grade is entered.
     * Testing: Ensure the total number of classes does not increase each time an invalid grade is entered.
     * LEARNING POINT: 14.3 / 5 equals 2.86, but the computer rounds differently with floating point values (double).
     * For example, the fraction 1/3 cannot be stored as a fraction.
     * The computer has limited space in memory to store decimal values.
     * With multiple calculations with decimals, this can create inaccurate calculations.
     * Think about when you use the graphing utility on your graphing calculator.
     * Have you ever calculated a zero or intercept and seen x = 3 represented as x = 2.9999998? Same concept.
