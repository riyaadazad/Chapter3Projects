     * Create a dice game to score the highest amount of points rolled.
     * Each round starts by rolling two dice and finding the total.
     * This is the initial score.
     * For the remaining of the round, the player chooses to stop or roll again.
     * Each additional roll occurs with ONLY ONE DIE.
     * If the value of the die is 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6, that number is added to the total.
     * After each roll, the player chooses to roll again or quit.
     * If the value is a 2, the round is automatically over and all points are lost for that round.
     * A game consists of 3 rounds.
     * The total game score is the sum of the 3 rounds.
     * Try to get a high score.
     * Have the user enter "r" to roll or "q" to quit after each roll in a round.
     * Have the user enter "y" to play the game again and "n" to quit.
     * You must create a method called rollDie that simulates rolling one die.
