    /*
     * Create a game that picks a random number between 1 and 100.
     * It then asks the user for a guess.
     * The program then tells the user if their guess was too high or too low.
     * The program repeats (i.e. it is in a loop) until the user guesses the correct answer or make 5 incorrect guesses.
     * When the game ends, if the user won, state how many guesses it took to find the number.
     * If the user lost, reveal the number.
     * HINT: As you test the game, print out the computer's random number to ensure the program's logic is correct.
     * Do not print out the computer's number when the program is complete.
     * Put the game inside a loop that allows the user to play it again.
     * You may use the following code (not shown).
     *
     * GRADING RUBRIC:
     *
     * +1 Generate a random number
     * +1 Prompts the player for a guess
     * +3 Accurately determines if the guess was higher or lower
     * +2 Limits the player to 5 guesses
     * +2 Game over - states the number of guesses taken or reveals the number
     * +1 Program correctly terminates
     *
     * PROGRAMMING STYLE EXPECTATIONS (POTENTIAL DEDUCTIONS MAY OCCUR):
     * Variable names are practical and self-documenting.
     * Code is consistently indented properly.
     * Code is commented.
     * Anything weird happens.
     * Only use break statements when using switch statements.
